## Role Details

### Account Executive / Sales

**Primary in**: Pre-Sales
**Key commands**: Reviews output of `/ais.presales.synthesize`, `/ais.presales.propose`, `/ais.presales.scope`

The AE owns the client relationship. They drive discovery conversations,
validate that the what-we-heard document captures the client's intent, and
manage the proposal-to-SOW process. They don't run the commands directly
but review and refine the outputs.

### Solutions Architect

**Primary in**: Pre-Sales, Setup
**Key commands**: `/ais.presales.synthesize`, `/ais.presales.propose`, `/ais.setup.plan`, `/ais.setup.architecture`

The SA bridges business requirements and technical solutions. They lead
technical discovery, validate ROM estimates, and ensure the architecture
supports the proposed approach. They select and customize playbooks.

### Project Manager

**Primary in**: Setup, Reporting
**Key commands**: `/ais.report.standup`, `/ais.report.status`, `/ais.report.project`, `/ais.report.metrics`

The PM manages the spec pipeline — ensuring specs progress through the
lifecycle, dependencies are unblocked, and stakeholders have visibility.
They are the primary consumer of reporting commands and share status
reports with clients.

### Business Analyst

**Primary in**: Specify
**Key commands**: `/ais.spec.specify`, `/ais.maintain.clarify`

The BA translates business needs into structured specifications. They are
the primary driver of the specify phase, ensuring user stories are clear
and requirements are testable. They validate that acceptance criteria
match business intent.

### Technical Lead

**Primary in**: Design, Architecture
**Key commands**: `/ais.spec.design`, `/ais.setup.architecture`, `/ais.setup.constitution`

The tech lead owns technical decisions. They run the design phase, establish
the constitution, and review task sequencing for technical correctness.
During implementation, they review code and ensure architectural alignment.

### Developers

**Primary in**: Tasks, Implement
**Key commands**: `/ais.spec.tasks`, `/ais.spec.implement`

Developers own individual specs through tasks and implementation. They
generate task breakdowns and execute them. Status updates happen
automatically as tasks are checked off.

### QA / Test Lead

**Primary in**: Design, Implement
**Key commands**: Reviews outputs of `/ais.spec.design`, `/ais.spec.tasks`

QA validates that specs are testable, designs include test strategies,
and task breakdowns have adequate test coverage. During implementation,
they run tests and validate acceptance criteria.

### Client Stakeholders

**Primary in**: Pre-Sales, Setup (approval)
**Key commands**: Consumes `/ais.report.status`

Clients provide requirements, review proposals, approve plans, and
consume status reports. They participate in spec review demos and
validate that deliverables meet acceptance criteria.
