# AIS Spec-Driven Development Framework

Unified workflow for decomposing raw requirements (RFPs, SOWs, transcripts) into structured, implementable specifications. Language/framework-agnostic.

## Workflow

Pre-sales is optional. Run project setup once, then cycle the spec lifecycle per feature:

```
PRE-SALES (optional, per engagement):
  /ais.presales.synthesize → specs/.presales/01-what-we-heard.md
  /ais.presales.propose    → specs/.presales/02-proposal.md
  /ais.presales.scope      → specs/.presales/03-sow.md

PROJECT SETUP (once):
  /ais.setup.plan          → specs/.project-plan/
  /ais.setup.architecture  → specs/.architecture/
  /ais.setup.constitution  → specs/constitution.md

SPEC LIFECYCLE (per feature):
  /ais.spec.brainstorm → Spec Seed Brief (optional pre-spec discovery)
  /ais.spec.specify   → specs/YYMM-NNN-name/spec.md     (defining)
  /ais.spec.design    → design.md, data-model, contracts  (planning)
  /ais.spec.tasks     → tasks.md, implementation-plan.md* (ready)
  /ais.spec.implement → execute tasks with review/evidence gates (in-dev → complete)

REPORTING (anytime):
  /ais.report.standup  → specs/.project-plan/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-standup.md
  /ais.report.status   → specs/.project-plan/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-status.md
  /ais.report.project  → specs/.project-plan/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-project.md
  /ais.report.retrospective → specs/.project-plan/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-retrospective.md

MAINTAIN (anytime):
  /ais.maintain.clarify → ingest new context or resolve spec ambiguities
  /ais.maintain.debug   → diagnose failures before fixing
```

## Key Conventions

- **Spec IDs**: `YYMM-NNN` format (e.g., `2602-001` = Feb 2026, first spec). Sub-specs use `.N` suffix.
- **Brainstorming**: `/ais.spec.brainstorm` is optional and produces a Spec Seed Brief only. It must not create `specs/YYMM-NNN-*` artifacts or modify `/ais.spec.specify`.
- **Pre-sales specs**: Pre-sales proposes specs by name. At delivery kickoff, `/ais.setup.plan` assigns `SPEC-YYMM-NNN` identifiers and creates directories.
- **Branches**: Spec work uses `YYMM-NNN-short-description` branches. Non-spec work uses `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `chore/`, `docs/` prefixes.
- **All PRs** squash-merge to main. No direct commits to main.
- **Framework releases**: Every PR must include exactly one release label: `release:patch`, `release:minor`, or `release:major`. Fill in the PR template's `## Release note`; `release:major` requires a `BREAKING CHANGE:` line.
- **Paths**: Always use absolute paths in commands and scripts.
- **Templates**: Live in `.specify/templates/`. Commands auto-fill them.
- **Playbooks**: Live in `.specify/playbooks/`. Domain-specific patterns for pre-sales and delivery.
- **Implementation Plans**: For larger or riskier specs, use `implementation-plan.md` guided by `PLANS.md`. Plans include validation evidence, review gates, worktree decisions, and recovery guidance.
- **Constitution**: `specs/constitution.md` defines non-negotiable standards. All designs must comply or justify violations.
- **Status tracking**: Spec.md YAML frontmatter is canonical. Report commands derive live status from repo state.

## Rules

- Never modify `.project-context/` directly — it's raw input, read-only.
- Always invoke workflow steps via slash commands (`/ais.spec.specify`, etc.), not manually.
- Use `/ais.spec.brainstorm` only when early ideas need optional discovery or scope shaping before `/ais.spec.specify`; it is not required for normal specification.
- For larger or riskier work, maintain `implementation-plan.md` as a living document from task generation through implementation.
- Tasks in `tasks.md` must follow checklist format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`
- Status is tracked in spec.md YAML frontmatter. Report commands derive live state from the repo.
- Bash scripts return JSON; commands parse the output for paths and metadata.
- Run consistency checks (built into `/ais.spec.tasks`) before implementation.
- During implementation, do not mark a spec complete until tasks are complete, review gates pass, constitution gates pass, and fresh validation evidence has been recorded.
- Use `/ais.maintain.debug` for repeated or unclear implementation, test, build, integration, or runtime failures; fixes must return through concrete tasks before `/ais.spec.implement` resumes.
- **PR release metadata**: Add exactly one release label to every PR. Use `release:patch` for docs/small fixes/routine maintenance, `release:minor` for backwards-compatible commands/templates/playbooks/workflows/scripts/behavior, and `release:major` for breaking workflow/prompt/template/command/file layout/CI contract changes.
- **PR footer**: Always end PR descriptions with: `Coded with [AIS-spec](https://github.com/ais-internal/ais-spec)`

`*` `implementation-plan.md` is created only when the spec is large enough or risky enough to need a living implementation plan.
