# Contributing

This document outlines how we manage our work, branches, pull requests, and merge responsibilities to keep the project maintainable, predictable, and stable.

# 1. How We Work: Spec-Driven Development

All feature work follows the **AIS spec-driven development workflow**. Raw project inputs are decomposed into a plan, architecture, and constitution during project setup. Individual features are then developed through a repeatable lifecycle: specify, design, task, implement.

See the **[README](README.md)** for the full command reference and workflow diagram, and **[docs/reference/workflow.md](docs/reference/workflow.md)** for the visual flowchart.

### Infrastructure Layers (When Applicable)

Infrastructure code uses a layered approach. The specific IaC tool (Terraform, Bicep, Pulumi, etc.) depends on the project, but the layering pattern is consistent:

| Layer Range | Purpose | Deploy Frequency |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| **000** | Pre-existing resources (already in the environment) | Reference only |
| **100-00 to 100-30** | Baseline infrastructure (networking, core services) | Infrequent |
| **100-40-{workload}** | Workload-specific resources | With each workload deploy |
| **200** | Development-only resources (sandboxes, emulators) | As needed |

### CI/CD Pipelines

Pipeline definitions live in `.github/workflows/`. The CI workflow (`ci.yml`) runs on all PRs to `main` and pushes to `main`:

| Job | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Markdown Lint** | Validates formatting across all `.md` files (specs, docs, contributing) |
| **Spec Frontmatter Lint** | Validates YAML frontmatter in `specs/*/spec.md` — required fields, enums, ID format, dates, dependencies |
| **Release Label Lint** | Requires every PR to include one release label and a usable release note |
| **Generated Command Drift** | Confirms generated command files match the shared prompts and repo instructions |
| **Shell Script Lint** | Validates Bash scripts with `bash -n` and ShellCheck error-level findings |
| **Workflow Lint** | Validates GitHub Actions workflow syntax with actionlint |

All checks are required to pass before a PR can merge. Concurrency is managed per-branch — pushing a new commit cancels the previous in-progress run. Lint rules are configured in `.markdownlint.jsonc` at the repo root. Frontmatter validation rules are defined in `.specify/scripts/bash/validate-frontmatter.sh`. Release validation rules are defined in `.specify/scripts/bash/validate-release-pr.sh`.
Generated command drift is checked with `bash .specify/scripts/bash/generate-commands.sh --check`.

# 3. Spec Versioning and Branching

## 3.1 Spec IDs

Specs use **YYMM-NNN** identifiers based on creation date:

- `2602-001` = February 2026, first spec
- `2602-002` = February 2026, second spec
- `2603-001` = March 2026, first spec

**Sub-specs** use dot notation: `2602-001.1`, `2602-001.2`

## 3.2 Branch Naming

Branch names **match the spec ID** with a short description suffix:

```
YYMM-NNN-short-description
```

Examples:
- `2602-001-core-api-data-model`
- `2602-002-dashboard-ui`
- `2602-001.1-oauth-flow`

For non-spec work, use conventional prefixes:

- `feature/<short-description>`
- `bugfix/<short-description>`
- `chore/<short-description>`
- `docs/<short-description>`

Use matching labels on your PR (`feature`, `bugfix`, `chore`, `docs`, `breaking-change`).

## 3.3 Feature Directory

Each spec branch gets a corresponding directory under `specs/`:

```
specs/2602-001-core-api-data-model/
  spec.md
  design.md
  implementation-plan.md   # optional, for larger or riskier work
  tasks.md
  ...
```

The `create-new-feature` script automates branch creation, numbering, and directory setup.

# 4. Framework Releases

The AIS Spec framework uses Semantic Versioning for the repository itself.
Spec IDs still use `YYMM-NNN`; semantic versions describe framework releases
published through GitHub Releases.

Every pull request to `main` must include exactly one release label:

| Label | Use for |
|-------|---------|
| `release:patch` | Docs, wording fixes, generated output refreshes, small bug fixes, and routine maintenance |
| `release:minor` | New backwards-compatible commands, templates, playbooks, workflows, scripts, or behavior |
| `release:major` | Breaking workflow, file layout, prompt contract, command behavior, template, generated artifact, or CI contract changes |

Each PR must also fill in the `## Release note` section of the PR template.
That content is copied into `CHANGELOG.md` and the GitHub Release after merge.

Breaking changes must use `release:major` and include a line in the release
note that starts with:

```
BREAKING CHANGE: Describe what downstream teams must change.
```

No maintainer creates release tags manually. After a PR merges to `main`, the
release workflow reads the PR label, bumps `VERSION` and `.specify/VERSION`,
prepends `CHANGELOG.md`, commits those release files back to `main`, and creates
the GitHub Release tag `vX.Y.Z`.

Release automation uses a dedicated GitHub App installation token. The app must
be installed on this repository, have `Contents: read/write` and
`Pull requests: read`, and be configured as the bypass actor for the `main`
ruleset. The workflow expects repo variable `AIS_RELEASE_APP_CLIENT_ID` and repo
secret `AIS_RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.

If Release Label Lint fails, add one release label and fill in the release note:

```
## Release note
Adds automated semantic release enforcement for every pull request.
```

---

# 5. Backlog Management

Work is tracked through the **project plan** (`specs/.project-plan/`) and individual spec task lists (`specs/YYMM-NNN-feature/tasks.md`).

- The project plan contains the **SPEC catalog** — the master list of all components with owners, scope, dependencies, and effort estimates.
- Each spec's `tasks.md` contains the implementation task breakdown, generated by `/ais.spec.tasks`.
- Larger or riskier specs may also include `implementation-plan.md` — a living execution document maintained during implementation.
- `/ais.github.sync` creates GitHub milestones and issues from the spec catalog and task lists for tracking in GitHub Projects.

### Priority and Ordering

- Specs are ordered by dependency (the project plan documents the dependency map and critical path).
- Tasks within a spec are dependency-ordered; tasks marked `[P]` can be parallelized.
- Work on the highest-priority unblocked spec first.

---

# 6. Branch and Pull Request Management

## 6.1 Branch Policy

The `main` branch follows these rules:

- All changes require a pull request.
- Each pull request requires **one approval** from a member of the designated maintainer group.
- Direct commits to `main` are not permitted.
- We prefer **Squash and Merge** when integrating changes into `main`.

These requirements are enforced by the `main release-protected` repository ruleset.
See **[docs/reference/repository-hardening.md](docs/reference/repository-hardening.md)** for the maintained control summary.

## 6.2 Pull Request Expectations

Before opening a pull request:

- Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`.
- Keep the pull request scoped to one logical feature or fix (typically one spec or one task group).
- Provide a clear description of what was changed and why.
- Reference the spec ID in the PR title or description (e.g., `SPEC-2602-001: Core API data model`).
- Remove unrelated or accidental changes.
- Add exactly one release label: `release:patch`, `release:minor`, or `release:major`.
- Fill in the `## Release note` section with text suitable for the changelog.

During review:

- Address feedback directly in the PR.
- Push updates as needed.
- Use the PR conversation for questions or clarification.

## 6.3 Responsibilities of the Developer Raising the PR

The developer who opens the pull request is responsible for the **entire lifecycle**:

### Before merging

- Shepherd the PR through review.
- Ensure the branch stays updated with `main`.

### After approval

- Perform the merge using Squash and Merge.
- Confirm the merge completes cleanly.

### After merging

- Monitor CI/CD pipelines triggered by the change.
- Investigate and resolve issues caused by the merge.
- Submit follow-up PRs if needed.

Ownership ends **only when `main` is stable** after the change.

## 6.4 Asking Questions

If anything is unclear, ask in the pull request or team channel.
Early clarification prevents rework.

# 7. Code and Quality Standards

## 7.1 Constitution Compliance

Every project maintains a **constitution** (`specs/constitution.md`) that defines non-negotiable standards: technology choices, quality gates, and integration patterns. All designs and implementations must comply with the constitution. If a violation is necessary, it must be justified and documented.

## 7.2 General Guidelines

- **Keep changes small and focused.** One spec, one PR. Break large specs into sub-specs if needed.
- **Follow existing patterns.** Before introducing a new pattern, check the constitution and existing code.
- **Write tests.** Tests live in `tests/` mirroring the `source/` structure.
- **Document decisions.** Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) live in the architecture artifacts. If you make a significant technical choice, record it.
- **Migrations must be idempotent and backwards-compatible** to support rolling deploys.
- **Secrets and credentials** must never be committed. Use environment variables or secret managers.
- GitHub secret scanning and push protection should remain enabled for this repository.

## 7.3 Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages. Since we squash-merge, the PR title and description become the commit message on `main` — make them count.

---

# 8. Summary

By following this operating model, we maintain:

- A clean, stable `main` branch
- A predictable, spec-driven flow of work
- Clear traceability from requirements through specs to implementation
- Reduced WIP and higher throughput
- Clear ownership at each stage
- A consistent experience for all contributors
